1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,096
You notice people moving their head up and down

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
Especially

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,800
The farthest country

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:18,432
And heads are bobbling everywhere

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,016
Thank you have a nice day

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,856
Thank you thank you very much

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Is it

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,952
Approval or false

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256
The answer can be all of the above

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
It's so unique

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
That it deserves

12
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
Its own video explanation

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,912
The no wobble baby wobble

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
So what's up

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
The I understand wobble

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
Presents the most interesting thing that I find 100% subconscious

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
If you ask people to do it on the spot

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
They can't

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,256
Something more understanding that person

20
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,096
A slower head wobble is only a little understanding or just a sign of

21
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,888
Respect

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
This is just one of the many unique things about Indian culture
