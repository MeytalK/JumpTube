Hi this is PC Rodger and on this short video I want to show you how you can save a webpage like this

2
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:17,152
Is homepage of pcrichard.com to a single-file some of you may be aware of the. MHT

3
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,760
He file for the. Mhtml file where you can do this

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:28,416
It's not a default option on Chrome or Firefox you might remember from Internet Explorer but who uses

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
That and that's a dead program anyway right

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Well with chrome is not too hard to do with Firefox is actually a add-on that you have to get

7
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
With chrome is pretty easy and I will show you normally when you go to save a webpage like this you

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
You have

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
The two options of web page HTML only and it would just get one file but it doesn't end

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
Include all the graphics or any files that are required to help make up that page or what page can play

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
What kind of a messy subdirectory or folder with a lot of files in it and

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
And it's not as bad as cleaning need so it's nice to be able to it in a single-file which is which is

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Almost perfect not quite but almost

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
And what, says he will just open another tab here

15
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
What type in Chrome colon slash slash flag so get this page here and let's just ask

16
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
Pro FM find

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
Multi pin mhtml

18
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,928
And you can see this option here save page as an HTML what quick and able

19
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
And then you simply have to restart Chrome

20
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
And now when you select save page as

21
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,704
Hand control s and save as a shortcut for that

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
You say that there are three options

23
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
What's the default actually being webpage single file

24
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,640
And if you could save you'll get just one file

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
With everything to Create page

26
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
And then when you go to open. Mhtml file you're probably find that the default is Internet Explorer on

27
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
Windows PC but you can also open in Chrome and you can either change the default because they open with

28
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Dropping into a chrome window and it should open

29
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,864
That's it for the short video
